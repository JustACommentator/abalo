With 59% in total market share as of December 2021, Google chrome is by far the most popular webbrowser for desktop, followed by Safari with 17% and Edge with 15%

Chrome is also the leading mobile browser, as of january 2022, it holds 61% marketshare worldwide, followed by Apple's Safari with 25%

Developing Abalo for the Firefox browser will yield the best results, as, of all the most popular browsers, Firefox offers the least compatibility with modern technologies,
but it still offers everything one needs to implement a site like Abalo.
The mobile browser market is dominated by Chrome and Safari. Since both of which offer greater compatibility with modern technologies than Firefox, Firefox remains the most
logical option
